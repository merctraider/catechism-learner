        <item>With these words, God would invite us to believe that He is our true Father, and that we are His true children, so that with all boldness and confidence we should ask Him, as dear children ask their dear father.</item>

        <item>God\'s name is certainly holy in itself; but we ask in this prayer that it may be made holy among us also.</item>

        <item>When God\'s Word is taught purely and correctly, and when we, as the children of God, also lead holy lives according to it. Help us to do this, dear Father in heaven! But whoever teaches or lives differently than God\'s Word teaches, he profanes God\'s name among us. Guard us against this, O heavenly Father!</item>

        <item>God\'s kingdom certainly comes by itself without our prayer; but we ask in this prayer that it may come to us also.</item>

        <item>When the heavenly Father gives us His Holy Spirit, so that by His grace we believe His holy Word, and lead godly lives, here in time and there in eternity.</item>

        <item>God\'s good and gracious will is surely done without our prayer; but we ask in this prayer that it may be done among us also.</item>

        <item>When God breaks and hinders every evil plan and will— like the will of the devil, the world and our flesh— that would keep us from hallowing God\'s name and prevent His kingdom from coming; and when He strengthens and keeps us steadfast in His Word and faith until the end. This is His good and gracious will.</item>

        <item>God surely also gives daily bread to all evil people without our petition; but we ask in this prayer that He would allow us to recognize this, and to receive our daily bread with thanksgiving.</item>

        <item>Everything that pertains to the needs and necessities of this life, such as food, drink, clothes, shoes, house, yard, land, animals, money, property, a godly spouse, godly children, godly servants, godly and faithful rulers, good government, good weather, peace, health, discipline, honor, good friends, trustworthy neighbors, and the like.</item>

        <item>We ask in this prayer that the Father in heaven would not look upon our sins or deny these petitions because of them; for we are not worthy of anything for which we ask, nor have we earned it; but we ask that He would give it all to us by grace; for we daily sin much, and surely deserve nothing but punishment. We in turn, will also truly forgive from the heart and gladly do good to those who sin against us.</item>

        <item>God surely tempts no one, but we ask in this prayer that God would guard and keep us so that the devil, the world, and our flesh may not deceive us, nor mislead us into false belief, despair, and other great shame and vice; and although we are troubled by these things, that we would, nevertheless, overcome and stand victorious in the end.</item>

        <item>We ask in this prayer, in summary, that the Father in heaven would deliver us from every sort of evil of body and soul, of property and honor, and finally, when our last hour comes, grant us a blessed end, and graciously take us from this valley of sorrow to Himself in heaven.</item>

        <item>That I should be certain that these petitions are acceptable to the Father in heaven and are heard by Him; for He Himself has commanded us so to pray, and has promised to hear us. Amen, Amen, which means: Yes, yes, it shall be so.</item>
